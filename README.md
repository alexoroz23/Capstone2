# Movies Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a movies recommender system using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda. While Springboard did not extensively cover Anaconda or Jupyter Notebook, I utilized these tools alongside Python to develop the project. Additionally, I revisited concepts learned in college regarding Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda to build the recommender system.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda

## Project Description
The movies recommender system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. Leveraging Python's data analysis and machine learning capabilities, the system analyzes user behavior and movie characteristics to generate accurate recommendations.

## Features
- User-specific recommendations
- Movie ratings prediction
- Genre-based recommendations
- Trending movies
