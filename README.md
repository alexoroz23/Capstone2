# Movies Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a movies recommender system using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda. While Springboard did not extensively cover Anaconda or Jupyter Notebook, I utilized these tools alongside Python to develop the project. Additionally, I revisited concepts learned in college regarding Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda to build the recommender system.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda

## Project Description
The movies recommender system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. Leveraging Python's data analysis and machine learning capabilities, the system analyzes user behavior and movie characteristics to generate accurate recommendations.

## Features
- Image of the Poster for the movie
- Genre-based recommendations
- Trending movies

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Heroku. You can access the deployed application [here](https://movie-recommendation-app-ae64b967a09c.herokuapp.com/).

## User Flow
1. Upon accessing the app, users can search for a movie by typing its title into the search bar.
2. The app will display the searched movie's title along with its poster.
3. Users can browse through the list of recommended movies based on the searched movie or select a movie from the recommendations.

## API
The project utilizes the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/authentication) for accessing movie data and metadata. Additionally, a dataset from TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset with over 5000 movies is used for analysis.

## Technology Stack
The technology stack used in this project includes Python for backend development, Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and machine learning, and Anaconda for managing project dependencies and environments.

## Additional Notes
This application is a simple yet effective tool for movie enthusiasts to discover new films and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences.
